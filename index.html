    <p>This world is both whack and full of beauty, in present and future. We all know this. However it seems there are some f*cked up systems at play in our daily lives that profit off of our suffering and helplessness. So, to combat my own sense of helplessness, I am starting this website. It's time take these things we all think about (or repress) and talk about them, research, and maybe even find or create alternatives. I mean, streaming is corrupt, social media just seems to be a bit psychotic and too intertwined with connection and creativity. Don't get me started on T*kT*k. Meanwhile, it's hard to not fall into a nihilistic perspective that the world is falling apart, which further divides us into our circles of sadness (whomp whomp). I think it's time we stopped letting algorithms and companies filter out our perceptions of life and ourselves. Lives are meant to be lived, not summed up into personas. If we reclaim control of our minds and our time, and build community outside the roads that have been paved to heaven and hell, who knows the beauty and awesome sh*t we could experience. Maybe even change the world. This site is a pathway, with no algorithm, with nothing to gain, fueled by a hope for more hope and action. This short thesis is just the beginning, but what use is a ball if it is not rolling?</p>
